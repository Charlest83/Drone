# Drone
Write a class that controls a drone. The class will have certain public methods that allow the UI to control the drone, and display the drone location.

The internal variables would track the drone’s location (x, y and z coordinates).

The public methods would allow the UI to change drone’s height and x/y position. The UI should mimic a set of drone controls:

Up/Down
Forward/Backward
Turn Left/Turn Right
There would also be a public method that retrieves the current drone position (x, y and z).

No actual graphic but you will create a menu. See sample as below:

Every move x or y or z coordinate increase or decrease by 1.

This program should not be GUI. Please submit source file and 2 screenshots of running program.
